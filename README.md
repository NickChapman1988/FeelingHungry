# Feeling Hungry â€“ Milestone Project 2
### View the live project [here.]()

The aim of the project was to create a mobile-first user-friendly recipe search app for users to find meal ideas. The user can search based on ingredients they have available and the app presents a range of recipes using those ingredients, allowing users to quickly and easily find meal ideas using things they already have in their kitchens.

## Overview
Everyone enjoys good food, but we don't always have the time or energy to be creative in the kitchen. This project aims to help with that, by allowing users to search for recipe ideas using ingredients that they already have available. Variety is the spice of life, or so the saying goes, so rather than making the same meals over and over week in week out, using the Feeling Hungry website to find new and exciting recipes allows users to do something different with the normal ingredients they have in their fridge or cupboards. 


## Description
This is a recipe search app built with a mobile-first design, but intended to be accessible on all devices. My aim with the project was to present a colourful, warm and evocative appearance that felt comforting and relaxed while putting users in the mood to cook, and try new things!

## UX
## Strategy

**Business Goals** 

* To make it easy for users to find meal ideas through simple ingredient searches.

* To encourage users to explore new ingredients, recipes and flavours.

* To encourage users to reduce food waste.

    
**User Stories**
* "Sometimes after a long day I have no idea what to cook for dinner, and we end up throwing something unhealthy in the oven or getting a takeaway. Being able to cook something using ingredients I've already got without having to think about it would be great!"

* "I'd like to try new things and cook different recipes that I've maybe not tried before, but wouldn't know where to start. Having a list of recipes where I can use the ingredients I've already got would make life so much easier."

* "We always have a full fridge and always end up cooking the same things each week. It would be nice to throw a bit of variety in there, and cook something different without having to go out and buy anything we don't normally buy."

* "I hate wasting food, but sometimes it's really difficult thinking of how to use leftover food up. I'd rather find a way of using things up than end up throwing them away, and it might introduce us to some new meals as well."
